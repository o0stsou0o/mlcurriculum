# mlcurriculum

This is a high school curriculum that was written and taught by Amal Nanavati, Christopher George, Eric Zhu and Stephen Tsou in coordination with the Carnegie Mellon University student organization Teknowledge and Google Ignite CS.  It was piloted as an after-school program in the South Fayette School District in Pittsburgh where Eric Zhu and Stephen Tsou would teach weekly and then later fine-tuned and converted to be part of the regular AP CS course.  It was modularly designed such that concepts of probability, data analysis and computer programming would lead into an introduction of neural networks while being flexible enough to enrich students who already had deep learning experience with tensorflow and pytorch to students who had not finished pre-calculus.  It was largely successful sans the week #3 lesson that taught recursion with decision trees hence it's removal.  

The overarching hope is that this curriculum can be fitted into the more advanced portions of Teknowledge's larger curriculum of serving schools in need on a global and local scale.
